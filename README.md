# Individual-assignment
The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that estimate individual stress levels based on various lifestyle factors such as social media usage, exercise hours, sleep patterns, and screen time. By analyzing these variables, we aim to understand their influence on stress and build reliable models to predict stress scores accurately.
